# CAENHV
Control of V6521N and V6521P via command line tools and simple txt file


Important info:

-- Most likely, have to do "sudo make install" for the CAENVMElib package
-- Double check the "port number" for the USB connection to the V1718. Would be changed in sethv.h header
-- Double check the address of the boards, set with the turney hex things, and set the values in the board header files
